This is a basic JavaFx application that compares the prices of dishes in 4 different food delivery apps.

It uses mySQL for a database about restaurants and makes use of JavaFx for the frontend. We have used CSS for buttons and icons. The SQL database contains 50 restaurants,10 per Area and a total of 5 areas of Pune. Each restaurant has its top 10 famous dishes and the prices of these dishes are compared according to the user's choice.
